## 1. ABSTRACT

When it comes to convenience, efficiency and safety, subway has become one of the most chosen forms of transport for people in metropolis. Yet passengers do not have many reliable sources to locate their destination except for subway broadcasts because popular localization services (e.g. Global Positioning System (GPS) and wireless localization technologies) are often unavailable underground. Therefore, we propose MetroEar, a precise subway destination alarm application for smartphones. MetroEar records ambient contextual sound by smartphone microphones, and infers the state of passengers (including stop, running, and interchange) during a subway trip. Based on the states, MetroEar further provides alarm services when approaching near a pre-set location so that passengers can focus on their interest such as listening to music, reading books, or taking a nap. The app works perfectly on major smartphones and tablets running on the most popular operating systems Android.

## 2. INTRODUCTION

This proposal is designed to suggest solutions for the unavailability of popular localization services and uselessness of mobile location and accelerometer sensors in the context of underground commute. Metro has proved its efficiency and convenience by increasing numbers of passengers. However, these passengers often cannot access to popular localization services due to the semi-closed environment of subway tunnel, blocking GPS and wireless signals. To track underground passengers, previous work either relies on a static subway timetable [1] to improve the detection accuracy, or only provides partial tracking services (i.e., stop and running of metros) [1]. However, the actual metro arrival time can vary dramatically from the timetable across zones and periods. Also, transferring time at interchange stations is missing, which is important for passengers to plan trips.

In order to tackle the above drawbacks, we propose MetroEye, a mobile service for accurate metro trip tracking. MetroEye records ambient sounds using smartphone microphones, and infers three important states during a whole subway trip: (1) Moving, the state that a passenger is on a running train. (2) Interchanging, the state that a passenger at an interchange. (3) Stopping, the state that a passenger is on a train halting at a station. These movement statuses will provide a mechanism for the application to trigger a wake cup alarm to subway passengers.
